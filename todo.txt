Was ist eigentlich mit spaces in exclude paths. Das k√∂nnte ein Problem sein:
    rsync -aAHSvX --delete --exclude=downloads --exclude=lost+found --exclude=.cache/chromium --exclude=.mozilla/firefox/*/Cache --exclude=.IntelliJIdea2016.1 --exclude=.config --exclude=.thunderbird /src ...

Packaging

Dupe deletion function.
    Get all duplicates file across all snapshots via fdupes.
        Only files with same permissions, timestamps, etc. are dupes.
            That is because you can't have them different on from another.
    Delete all dupes but one, but keep one file.
        Make hardlinks of that file to the places where the dupes where
            keep the original name of cause.
    Add Config to set interval for dupe removal
    Add an option to define a minimum file size under which files will be excluded from dupe removal.
      Dupe removal does not make sense for little files.
